Project 17 - Days 62-63 - [[https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/62][HackingWithSwift.com/100/62]]

** Day 62
 - linear & angular damping, angular velocity
 - didBegin(contact:) and pixel-perfect collision detection using the texture init of SKPhysicsBody
 - using a Timer to create enemies at a set interval:
#+BEGIN_SRC Swift
gameTimer = Timer.scheduledTimer(timeInterval: 0.35, target: self, selector: #selector(createEnemy), userInfo: nil, repeats: true)
#+END_SRC
 - Destroy the enemies when they leave the frame in update(currentTime) which gets executed every frame
 - Clamp the players movement range in touchesMoved()
** Day 63 - Challenge
1. Stop the player from cheating by lifting their finger and tapping elsewhere – try implementing touchesEnded() to make it work.
2. Make the timer start at one second, but then after 20 enemies have been made subtract 0.1 seconds from it so it’s triggered every 0.9 seconds. After making 20 more, subtract another 0.1, and so on. Note: you should call invalidate() on gameTimer before giving it a new value, otherwise you end up with multiple timers.
3. Stop creating space debris after the player has died.
